<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

People use sentences to express their feelings, some may be sarcastic, some may be positive, some of them can be negative as well as neutral. I found it interesting to develop a tool which can figure out the type of sentence and here we are!

Here's why:
* To apply python sentiment analysis cncept in real life
* To learn how python libraries contribute in sentiment analysis
* To understand the concept and usage of Flask in application
* To ease the process of analyzing entity wise sentiment from huge number of senetences which is manually unfeasible
* Not the least, to work upon data apply the concepts of python for data science

Of course, there is much more to dive deep in sentiment analysis as well as data world. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have have contributed to expanding this project!

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.
